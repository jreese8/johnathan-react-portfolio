                          Hello! I am new to coding and excited for this new change!
                          I was initially studying veterinary medicine in Saint Kitts, an island in the Caribbean, which is shown in the image above.

                        <br/>
                        <p>
                          I was only three months into the program when the COVID pandemic hit.
                          Due to the difficulties of international travel and the unforeseeable end of the pandemic,
                          I have made the switch from studying medicine to studying code. It was a bit daunting making this huge leap, but I have always loved video games and had interest in computer programming.
                        </p>
