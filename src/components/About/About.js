          Hello! I am Johnathan, a Fullstack Web Developer that has earned a Certificate from the University of Richmondâ€™s Fullstack Coding Bootcamp.  
          <br>
          </br>
          <br>
          </br>
          Initially, I was studying veterinary medicine in Saint Kitts, an island in the Caribbean, which is shown in the image behind. 
          However, due to COVID and an unfortunate injury, I switched from studying veterinary medicine to studying code.
          <br>
          </br>
          <br>
          </br>
          It was a bit daunting making this huge leap, but I have always loved video games and had interest in computer programming. 
          Nonetheless, it has been an incredible change for the better!
          <br>
          </br>
          <br>
          </br>
          I enjoy designing and creating responsive websites. 
          It is also rewarding when I am able to solve an issue after a bit of research. I look forward to the future as a web developer!
